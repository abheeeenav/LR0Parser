## 🧐 Problem Statement: <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Simulate the LR(0) parsing algorithm.  
This include, DFA design, parsing table creation and finally the parsing of user-defined string. 
While parsing the step by step parsing should be demonstrated. 
Grammar should be read from a text file and impose all necessary constraints on the input. 
Make sure all the intermediate components should be visible while simulation and keep the program as interactive as possible
